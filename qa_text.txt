1.1.
What is steel structure ? What are the requirements
that govern the structural design ?
Answer
A
Steel Structure : A steel structure is an assemblage of a group of
and members to transfer (elements) them safely expected to the to ground. sustain Depending their share on of the applied orientation forces
of the member in the structure and its structural use, the member is
subjected to forces, either axial, bending or torsion, or combination of
forces.
B.
Requirements : Following are the requirements that govern the
structural design
1.
It should have adequate strength.
2.
It should have adequate stability and rigidity.
3.
It should be durable.
4.
It should not interfere with the functional requirement.
5.
It should be economical.
6.
It should be readily adaptable to future extension.

Que 1.3.
What is structural steel and what are its properties ?
OR
Describe some of the mechanical properties of structural steel.
AKTU 2014-15, Marks 05
Answer
Steel : It is probably the most versatile and commonly used structural
material. The essential elements in steel are metallic iron and the
element of non-metallic carbon with small quantity of other elements
such as silicon, chromium and copper.
