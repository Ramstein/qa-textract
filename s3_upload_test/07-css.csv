1,AVEI:L,AVEI:L 1.1. WHAT IS STEEL STRUCTURE ? WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT GOVERN THE STRUCTURAL DESIGN ?,"A STEEL STRUCTURE : A STEEL STRUCTURE IS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF A GROUP OF AND MEMBERS TO TRANSFER (ELEMENTS) THEM SAFELY EXPECTED TO THE TO GROUND. SUSTAIN DEPENDING THEIR SHARE ON OF THE APPLIED ORIENTATION FORCES OF THE MEMBER IN THE STRUCTURE AND ITS STRUCTURAL USE, THE MEMBER IS SUBJECTED TO FORCES, EITHER AXIAL, BENDING OR TORSION, OR COMBINATION OF FORCES. B. REQUIREMENTS : FOLLOWING ARE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT GOVERN THE STRUCTURAL DESIGN 1. IT SHOULD HAVE ADEQUATE STRENGTH. 2. IT SHOULD HAVE ADEQUATE STABILITY AND RIGIDITY. 3. IT SHOULD BE DURABLE. 4. IT SHOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT. 5. IT SHOULD BE ECONOMICAL. 6. IT SHOULD BE READILY ADAPTABLE TO FUTURE EXTENSION."
2,WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF STEEL USED AS A STRUCTURAL MATERIAL ?,WRITE ADVANTAGES OF STEEL USED AS A STRUCTURAL MATERIAL.,"A ADVANTAGES : FOLLOWING ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF STEEL USED AS STRUCTURAL MATERIAL 1. STEEL IS THE ULTIMATE RECYCLABLE MATERIAL. 2. THEY CAN BE ERECTED AT A FASTER RATE. 3. ADDITIONS AND ALTERNATIONS CAN BE MADE EASILY TO STEEL STRUCTURES. 4. STRUCTURAL STEELS IS TOUGH I.E., IT HAS BOTH STRENGTH AND DUCTILITY 5. PROPERLY MAINTAINED STEEL STRUCTURE HAS A LONG LIFE. 6. STEEL BEING A DUCTILE MATERIAL DOES NOT FAIL SUDDENLY. B. DISADVANTAGES : FOLLOWING ARE DISADVANTAGES OF STEEL USED AS A STRUCTURAL MATERIAL 1. IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CORROSION AND BUCKLING 2. STEEL MEMBERS ARE COSTLY. 3. MAINTENANCE COST IS HIGH. 4. THEIR SHAPE AND SIZE ARE STANDARD SO WORKED ACCORDING TO THE STANDARD SHAPE AND SIZE. STRUCTURAL STEEL."
3,WHAT IS STRUCTURAL STEEL AND WHAT ARE ITS PROPERTIES ?,DESCRIBE SOME OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF STRUCTURAL STEEL.,"STEEL : IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST VERSATILE AND COMMONLY USED STRUCTURAL MATERIAL. THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS IN STEEL ARE METALLIC IRON AND THE ELEMENT OF NON-METALLIC CARBON WITH SMALL QUANTITY OF OTHER ELEMENTS SUCH AS SILICON, CHROMIUM AND COPPER. PROPERTIES : FOLLOWING ARE THE PROPERTIES OF STRUCTURAL STEEL 1. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES : I. UNIT MASS OF STEEL, P = 7850 KG/M3. II. MODULUS OF ELASTICITY, E 2.0 X 105 N/MM2 III. POISSON'S RATIO, U 0.3. IV. MODULUS OF RIGIDITY, G = 0.769 X 105 N/MM2. V. COEFFICIENT OF THERMAL EXPANSION, A, 12 X 10-6/C. 2. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES : YIELD STRESS, I. II.

4,DISCUSS IN BRIEF A GENERAL CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF STEEL AND EFFECT OF CARBON ON STEEL.,GIVE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF STRUCTURAL STEEL AND DISCUSS THE AMOUNT OF CARBON IN IT.,"A. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF STEEL : THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS OF SOME TYPICAL STEELS, SPECIFIED BY THE BUREAU OF INDIAN STANDARDS ARE LISTED IN TABLE 1.4.1. TABLE 1.4.1. TYPES OF DESIGNATION C MN S P SI CATHON STEEL (MAX) (MAX) (MAUR) (MAX) (MAX EQUIVALENT STANDARD FE 410 A 0.23 1.5 0.050 0.050 0.4 0.42 STRUCTURAL STEEL FE 410 B 0.22 1.5 0.045 0.045 0.4 0.41 (IS : 2062) FE 410 C 0.20 1.5 0.040 0.040 0.4 0.39 MICRO-ALLOYED FE 440 0.20 1.3 0.050 0.050 0.45 0.40 MEDIUM/ HIGH FE 540 0.20 1.6 0.045 0.045 0.45 0.44 STRENGTH STEEL (IS : 8500) FE 590 0.22 1.8 0.045 0.045 0.45 0.48 B. AMOUNT OF CARBON : IRON-CARBON ALLOYS CONTAINING UP TO 2 PERCENT CARBON ARE CALLED STEEL WHILE THOSE HAVING MORE THAN 2 PERCENT ARE CALLED CAST STEEL. C. EFFECT OF CARBON ON STEEL: FOLLOWING ARE THE EFFECT OF CARBON ON STEEL DESIGN OF STRUCTURE III 1. WITH INCREASE IN CARBON, THE TENSILE STRENGTH AND HARDNESS OF STEE INCREASES BUT THE DUCTILITY AND TOUGHNESS FALL. ALSO, MORE CARBON WILL CAUSE STEEL TO BE MORE BRITTLE AND WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS WELDABILITY 2. IF THE CARBON CONTENT IS REDUCED, THE STEEL WILL BE SOFTER AND MORE DUCTILE BUT ALSO WEAKER.
